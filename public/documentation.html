      <p>Movie_API is the serverside component of a web application named myFlix.
        The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies,
        directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information,
        and create a list of their favorite movies.

A real person in a fictional setting would not qualify a production for this genre. If the focus is primarily on events, rather than a person, use History instead. Objective.
